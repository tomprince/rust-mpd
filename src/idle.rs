//! The module defines structures and protocols for asynchronous MPD communication
//!
//! The MPD supports very simple protocol for asynchronous client notifications about
//! different player events. First user issues `idle` command with optional argument
//! to filter events by source subsystem (like "database", "player", "mixer" etc.)
//!
//! Once in "idle" mode, client connection timeout is disabled, and MPD will notify
//! client about next event when one occurs (if originated from one of designated
//! subsystems, if specified).
//!
//! (Actually MPD notifies only about general subsystem source of event, e.g.
//! if user changed volume, client will get `mixer` event in idle mode, so
//! it should issue `status` command then and check for any mixer-related field
//! changes.)
//!
//! Once some such event occurs, and client is notified about it, idle mode is interrupted,
//! and client must issue another `idle` command to continue listening for interesting
//! events.
//!
//! While in "idle" mode, client can't issue any commands, except for special `noidle`
//! command, which interrupts "idle" mode, and provides a list queued events
//! since last `idle` command, if they occurred.
//!
//! The module describes subsystems enum only, but the main workflow is determined by
//! [`IdleGuard`](struct.IdleGuard.html) struct, which catches mutable reference
//! to original `Client` struct, thus enforcing MPD contract in regards of (im)possibility
//! to send commands while in "idle" mode.
